# Tomfoolery

We do a little trolling

(I really suck at names, so tomfoolery is the placeholder, as it's easy to find and replace)

This project is a Gradle Nightmare:tm: containing both a Fabric client mod and a Paper server plugin.

No idea if this will go anywhere, or what it will even do.

^ edit, looks like it wont go anywhere for now, but some of this cursedness has moved on into hydrazine (as if it wasnt cursed enough lol)
